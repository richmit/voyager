# HP Voyager (HP-12C, HP-15C, & HP16C) Programs

Just a few programs for HP's Voyager series.  I'm posting these in the hope that others may find them useful.

You can learn more about this library on the project web page:

  - [Programs For the HP-15C](https://github.com/richmit/voyager/blob/main/docs/hp15.html)
  - [Programs For the HP-16C](https://github.com/richmit/voyager/blob/main/docs/hp16.html)


Have fun.
